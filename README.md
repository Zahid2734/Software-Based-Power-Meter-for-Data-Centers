# Software-Based-Power-Meter-for-Data-Centers
In the era of cloud computing, data centers have emerged as possible
solutions, without which a lot of our daily work could not function properly.
Modern data centers consist of various components such as, communication
and storage equipment, power supplies, air conditioning (HVAC) equipment
and monitoring systems etc. Power plays a critical role in the data center.
Because of the high demand for uninterrupted services, many data centers
are equipped with redundant power supply units and backup systems. The
main goal of our project is to measure the power of individual servers from
the server rack in a data center. But without using a conventional power
meter, we are using a different approach which utilizes the high-frequency
switching operation (40 to 100 kHz) of the power factor correction circuit
universally built in todayâ€™s server power supply units(PSU). By using DNN
we will try to separate the mixed signature of all servers in a rack and then
use the notion of PFC circuit to estimate the power of individual servers.
